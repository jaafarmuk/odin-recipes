    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
        <li>Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand. If youâ€™re new to yeasted doughs, my How to Knead Dough post and video can help with this step.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes..</li>
